      <p class="big">The government’s struggle to reunite children with their families is about to get more complicated</p>
      
      <p>On June 26, Judge Dana Sabraw issued an order that halted most family separations at the US–Mexico border. He also set a timetable for the government to reunite already separated families: The Trump administration had 14 days for children under 5, and 30 days for children aged 5 and over.</p>

      <p>The government struggled to meet the deadline for reunifying fewer than 100 children under 5. Now, it is against the clock as the deadline approaches to reunify all children 5 and over, a much larger undertaking that needs to be complete in two weeks.</p>

      <p>Officials are expected to run into at least some of the same problems that plagued efforts with the under-5 group, only on a far greater scale — including not knowing how to find a deported parent, delays in confirming a parent–child relationship, and checking a parent's criminal history.</p>

      <p>Sabraw said he expected the government's trouble finding deported parents to be a big issue going forward, considering the nearly 3,000 kids still in custody and the fact that it proved to be a problem for the under-5 kids.</p>
